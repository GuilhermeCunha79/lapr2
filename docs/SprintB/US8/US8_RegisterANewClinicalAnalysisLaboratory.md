# US 008 -  Register a new clinical analysis laboratory

## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description

As an administrator, I want to register a new clinical analysis laboratory stating which
kind of test(s) it operates.


### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 


**From the specifications document:**

>	All clinical analysis laboratories perform clinical blood tests, and a subset of
these laboratories also performs Covid-19 tests. 

**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** What information is associated with a clinical Analysis laboratory?(e.g. designation, localization...) 

> **Answer:** Each Clinical Analysis Laboratory is characterized a Laboratory ID, Name, Address, Phone Number, TIN number.


> **Question:** What rules are applicable to such data?
  
> **Answer:** The Chemical Laboratory is characterized by the following attributes: Name; Address; Phone Number;TIN number.
>Many labs has only one chemical lab.


> **Question:** When the administrator is registering a Clinical Analysis Laboratory and typing the information does he type the laboratory ID or is it generated by the system afterwards?

> **Answer:** The Laboratory ID is introduced manually.


> **Question:** What defines a test type category?

> **Answer:** Each category has a name and a unique code. There are no subcategories.


> **Question** When starting a new clinical analysis laboratory registration, should the entered requested data be showed to the user for confirmation purposes?

> **Answer** It is always a good practice to validate and ask for confirmation.
 

> **Question**  Are two Clinical Analysis Laboratories with the same:
Laboratory ID 
name 
address 
phone Number 
TIN number
allowed to exist?

> **Answer** Only the name of two CAL can be same.


> **Question** Can a parameter be classified in more than one parameter category?

> **Answer** No. Each parameter has only one category. There are no subcategories. 
### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria


* **AC1:** All required fields must be filled in.
* **AC2:** Phone number must have 11 digits
* **AC3:** TIN must have 10 digits
* **AC4:** Address: A string with no more than 30 characters
* **AC5:** Laboratory ID: five alphanumeric characters
* **AC6:** Name: A string with no more than 20 characters
* **AC7:** Type of tests performed by the lab

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

* There is a dependency to "US09 Specify a new type of test" since a test type must exist in order to state the type of test performed in a laboratory.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data


**Input Data:**
    
    * phone number
	* a name
    * a TIN number
	* a laboratory ID (only for clinical analysis laboratories)
	* an adress
	* testType
**Selected data**
* Type of test chosen


**Output Data:**
* List of existing labs
* (In)Success of the operation

### 3.1. Rationale

**SSD - Alternative 1 is adopted.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1 |Register a New Clinical Analysis Laboratory|... interacting with the actor? | RegisterNewClinicalAnalysisLaboratoryUI   | UI Layer is always responsible for user interactions|
| Step 2 |Request for the necessary credentials|... requesting credentials needed? | RegisterNewClinicalAnalysisUI | UI Layer is responsible for user interaction |
| Step 4 |Register New Clinical Analysis Laboratory|	send command to create new clinical analysis laboratory? | NewClinicalAnalysisController | Controller makes the bridge between UI layer and Domain Layer |
| Step 5 |Initiate store process|... start the store process for the clinical analysis laboratory being created? | Company | HC+LC: Company delegates some of its responsibilities to other classes |
| Step 6 |Register New Clinical Analysis Laboratory|... instantiating new parameter category? | ParameterCategoryStore | Creator: R1/2 | 			  		 |	... knowing to which organization the user belongs to? | Platform  | IE: has registed all Organizations |
| Step 7: Save Data |... saving the introduced data? | ParameterCategory  | IE: instance of object created has its own data.  |
| Step 8: Validate Clinical Analysis Laboratory |... validating all data (local validation)? | ClinicalAnalysisLaboratoryStore | IE: knows its own data.| 
| Step 9: Present data to user |...requesting confirmation for data introduced? | RegisterNewClinicalAnalysisUI | UI Layer is responsible for user interaction |
| Step 11: Save Clinical Analysis Laboratory |... send command to save the created Clinical Analysis Laboratory? | NewClinicalAnalysisController | Controller makes the bridge between UI layer and Domain Layer| 
| Step 12: Save Clinical Analysis Laboratory |... saving the created Clinical Analysis Laboratory? | ClinicalAnalysisLaboratoryStore | IE: stores all Clinical Analysis Laboratories created| 
| Step 13: Validate Clinical Analysis Laboratory |... validating all data at global level? | ClinicalAnalysisLaboratoryStore | IE: Company Knows all existing Clinical Analysis Laboratories| 
| Step 14: Add Clinical Analysis Laboratory |... add created clinical analysis laboratory to the list? | ClinicalAnalysisLaboratoryStore | IE: Responsible to add Clinical Analysis Laboratories to the list| 
| Step 15: Operation success |... informing operation success?| RegisterNewClinicalAnalysisUI | UI Layer is responsible for user interactions.  |   | 

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

* Company
* ClinicalAnalysisLaboratory
* ClinicalAnalysisLaboratoryStore

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 

* RegisterNewClinicalAnalysisUI
* RegisterNewClinicalAnalysisController
