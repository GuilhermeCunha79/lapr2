# US 03 - To register a new client

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

*As a receptionist of the laboratory, I want to register a client in order to access the application.*

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 
*From the Specification Document:*

> "Typically, the client arrives at one of the clinical analysis laboratories with a lab order prescribed by
a doctor. Once there, a receptionist asks the client’s citizen card number, the lab order (which
contains the type of test and parameters to be measured), and registers in the application the test to
be performed to that client."
>
> "In case of a new client, the receptionist registers the client in the application. To register a client, the
receptionist needs the client’s citizen card number, National Healthcare Service (NHS) number,
birth date, sex, Tax Identification number (TIN), phone number, e-mail and name."
  
*From the Client Specifications:*

> **Question:** What attributes a Receptionist have? 
>
>**Answer:** 
Employee ID;
Organization Role;
Name;
Address;
Phone Number;
E-Mail;
Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) code.
> 
> **Question:** What attributes a Client have?
>
>**Answer:**
Name;
Citizen Card Number;
NHS number;
TIN number;
Birth Date;
Sex;
Phone number;
Email.
> 
> **Question:** Does the receptionist need to be logged in the app to perform the regist?
> 
> **Answer:**
> Yes
> 
> **Question:** What parameters asked by the receptionist should the system use to create the password of the new client?
> 
> **Answer:**
> The password should be randomly generated. 
> 
> **Question:** How the system respond in the event of creating a new user with the same attributes of an already existing user?
> 
> **Answer:**
> This should be treated as an error. A subset of the attributes of any client are unique.
> 
> **Question:** After being registered by the receptionist, should the client receive some kind of confirmation e-mail in order to finish the registration?
>
> **Answer:**
> The client only receives an e-mail informing that the registration was successful and that he can start to use the system. The email includes the client password
> 
> **Question:** During the registration of the client, if he gives a phone number already used by another customer, should the registration continue normally, or should it be cancelled?
>
> **Answer:**
> The email address and phone number should be unique for each user . The system should present a message informing about the error and asking for a different phone number.



### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

* **AC1:** The client must become a system user.
* **AC2:** The "auth" component available on the repository must be reused (without modifications).
* **AC3:** Name have a maximum of 35 characters;
* **AC4:** Citizen Card must have 16 digit number;
* **AC5:** NHS number must have 10 digit number;
* **AC6:** Birth Date must be in DD/MM/YYYY format;
* **AC7:** Phone number must have 11 digit number.
* **AC8:** The sex of the client is optional and are only two genders available (Male/Female).
* **AC9:** The password should have 10 alphanumeric characters.
* **AC9:** When registering a client with an already existing email, phone number, the system must reject such operation with an error and the user must have the change to modify the typed reference.


### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

There is dependency with the US07 - Register an employee, because in order to register a new client the system
must have a receptionist logged in, so the receptionist can register the client.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

*Input Data*

-Typed Data: Name; Citizen Card Number; NHS number; TIN number; Birth Date; Sex; Phone Number; Email.

-Output Data: The client receives an email with the registration confirmation and his password
(In)Success of the operation.

### 2.2. Other Remarks

*Use this section to capture some additional notes/remarks that must be taken into consideration into the design activity. In some case, it might be usefull to add other analysis artifacts (e.g. activity or state diagrams).* 



## 3. Design - User Story Realization 

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1: Start new parameter |... interacting with the actor? | RegisterAnewClientUI | UI Layer is always responsible for user interactions |         
| Step 2: Ask for the data |... requesting data needed? | RegisterAnewClientUI | UI Layer is responsible for user interaction |
| Step 4: Create new parameter |... send command to register a new client? | RegisterClientController | Controller makes the bridge between UI layer and Domain Layer|
| Step 5: Initiate store process|... start the store process for the client being registered? | Company | HC+LC: Company delegates some of its responsibilities to other classes |      
| Step 6: Register new Client |... instantiating new Client? | ClientStore | Creator: R1/2 |      
| Step 7: Save Data |... saving the introduced data? | Client | IE: instance of object created has its own data.  |
| Step 8: Validate client |... validating all data (local validation)? | ClientStore | IE: knows its own data.|
| Step 9: Present data to user |...requesting confirmation for data introduced? | RegisterAnewClient | UI Layer is responsible for user interaction |
| Step 11: Save client |... send command to save the created client? | CreateNewParameterController | Controller makes the bridge between UI layer and Domain Layer|
| Step 12: Save client |... saving the created client? | ClientStore | IE: stores all parameters created|
| Step 13: Validate client globally |... validating all data at global level? | ClientStore | IE: Company Knows all existing Clients|
| Step 14: Add client |... add created parameter to the list? | ClientStore | IE: Responsible to add new Client to the list|
| Step 15: Operation success |... informing operation success?| RegisterAnewClientUI | UI Layer is responsible for user interactions.  |


### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:
 * Company
 * Client
 * ClientStore

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
 * RegisterClientUI  
 * RegisterClientController

# 4. Tests 
*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling.* 

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Client class with null values. 

	 @Test(expected = NullPointerException.class)
    public void garanteeNullClientIsntCreatedWithAllDataAndSex() {
        new Client(null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null);
    }

**Test 2:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Client class with null values.

	 @Test(expected = NullPointerException.class)
    public void garanteeNullClientIsntCreatedWithAllDataAndSex() {
        new Client(null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null);
    }



# 5. Construction (Implementation)

*In this section, it is suggested to provide, if necessary, some evidence that the construction/implementation is in accordance with the previously carried out design. Furthermore, it is recommeded to mention/describe the existence of other relevant (e.g. configuration) files and highlight relevant commits.*

            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Designation cannot be blank.");

        this.designation = designation;
        this.authFacade = new AuthFacade();
    }

# 6. Integration and Demo 

*In this section, it is suggested to describe the efforts made to integrate this functionality with the other features of the system.*


# 7. Observations

*Overall, it is believed that the work done is consistent and meets the requirements specified by the Client.*
