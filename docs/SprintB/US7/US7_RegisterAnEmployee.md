# US 007 - To register a new employee

## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description


As an administrator, I want to register a new employee and give access to the application.



### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 


**From the specifications document:**

>	No information in the specifications document 



**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** What kind of information does the company store about their employees and owned laboratories?
>  
> **Answer:** Employee ID; Organization Role; Name; Address; Phone Number; E-Mail; Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) code.
>
> The Specialist Doctor has an additional attribute:
Doctor Index Number.

> **Question:** Is there any size limit to the employee's name?
>
> **Answer:** Employee Name is a string with no more than 35 characters".

> **Question:** Is there any validation that needs to be done on the employee's email format and size?
>
> **Answer:** The format of an e-mail address is well-known. Attribute validation is always a good practice.

> **Question:** Regarding the registration of a new employee, which is the organization role's format?
>
> **Answer:** Organization Role is a string with no more than 15 characters.

> **Question:** When registering a new employee should the administrator write or select his role
>
> **Answer:** The administrator should write the role when he is registering a new employee.

> **Question:** What is the length of the Doctor index number and does it need to be validated?
>
> **Answer:** The length is 6 digits and for now, it is not necessary to confirm that the code really exists.
 
> **Question:** What is the length of the SOC number and is it generated or manually introduced by the admin?
>
> **Answer:** The SOC number is 4 digits, and it is introduced by the administrator.


### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria


* **AC1:** All required fields, namely Organization role, name, address, phone, e-mail and SOC code, must be filled in.
* **AC2:** The SOC number is 4 digits and introduced by the admin
* **AC3:** When creating an employee with an already existing reference, the system must reject such operation, and the user must have the change to modify the typed reference.
* **AC4:** When creating an employee, the id of the employee should be generated automatically with the format of employee's name initials and five digits.
* **AC5:** The doctor index number is 6 digits and does not need to be confirmed
* **AC6:** Employee is a String with no more than 35 characters
* **AC7:** The e-mail format should be validated


### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

* None

### 1.5 Input and Output Data


**Input Data:**

* Typed data:
	* Name;
	* Address;
	* Phone Number;
	* E-Mail;
	* Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) code.
	* Organization Role;
	* Doctor Index Number (Only when adding a new specialist doctor)
	
* Generated data:
	* Employee ID;

**Output Data:**

* (In)Success of the operation

### 3.1. Rationale

**SSD - Alternative 1 is adopted.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1/2/3     |	... interacting with the actor? | RegisterEmployeeUI   |  Pure Fabrication: there is no reason to assign this responsibility to any existing class in the Domain Model.           |
| 			     |	... instantiating a new Employee? | Employee with Administrator role | Creator (Rule 1): in the DM Employee can have a administrator role.   |
|       		 |	... knowing the employee roles to show? | Company | IE: Employee roles are defined by the Company. |
| Step 4 	  	 |	... connecting the UI layer to the Domain? | RegisterEmployeeController | Controller is responsible for making the bridge between UI and Domain |
| Step 5  		 |	... send the Employee List of the company employee store? | Company  | IE: Company knows all its Employee  |
| Step 6  		 |	... sending the inputted data to the object constructor? | EmployeeStore  | The employee store is responsible for sending data to the Employee constructor and store the object later.  |
| Step 7  		 |	... saving the inputted data? | Employee  | IE: object created in this step has its own data.  |
|                |	... validating all data (local validation)? | Employee | IE: owns its data.| 
| Step 9	     |	... asking user to confirm data? | RegisterEmployeeUI | UI Layer is responsible for user interactions.|  
| Step 11	     |	... asking to save the Employee after admin validated data? | RegisterEmployeeController | Sends UI commands to the Domain layer.| 
| Step 12	     |	... saving the Employee after admin validated data? | EmployeeStore | IE: stores all employees.| 
| Step 8/13	     |	... validating all data (global validation)? | EmployeeStore | IE: knows all its employees.| 
| Step 14	  	 |	... adding the created employee to the employee list? | EmployeeStore | IE: owns all its employee.| 
| Step 15  		 |	... informing operation success?| RegisterEmployeeUI  | UI Layer is responsible for user interactions.  | 

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * Employee
 * Company
 * SpecialistDoctor
 * EmployeeStore

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 

 * RegisterEmployeeUI  
 * RegisterEmployeeController

# 4. Tests 

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Task class with null values. 

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
		Task instance = new Task(null, null, null, null, null, null, null);
	}
	

**Test 2:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Task class with a reference containing less than five chars - AC2. 

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureReferenceMeetsAC2() {
		Category cat = new Category(10, "Category 10");
		
		Task instance = new Task("Ab1", "Task Description", "Informal Data", "Technical Data", 3, 3780, cat);
	}


*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.* 

# 5. Construction (Implementation)


## Class CreateEmployeeController 

    public boolean createEmployee(String role, String name, String address, String phoneNumber, String email, int soc){
        this.emp = this.empStore.createEmployee(role, name, address, phoneNumber, email, soc);
        return saveEmployee();
    }

    public boolean createSpecialistDoctor(String role, String name, String address, String phoneNumber, String email, int soc, int indexNumber){
        this.emp = this.empStore.createSpecialistDoctor(role,name,address,phoneNumber,email,soc, indexNumber);
        return saveEmployee();
    }

	private boolean saveEmployee() {
        return this.empStore.saveEmployee(emp);
    }


## Class Employee


	public Employee(String role, String name, String address, String phoneNumber, String email, int soc) {
        employeeCount++;
        setRole(role);
        setName(name);
        setAddress(address);
        setPhoneNumber(phoneNumber);
        setEmail(email);
        setSoc(soc);
        this.employeeID = employeeIdCreator();
    }



# 6. Integration and Demo 

* A new option on the Employee menu options was added.

* Some demo purposes some tasks are bootstrapped while system starts.


# 7. Observations

Platform and Organization classes are getting too many responsibilities due to IE pattern and, therefore, they are becoming huge and harder to maintain. 

Is there any way to avoid this to happen?
