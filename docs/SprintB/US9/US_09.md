## 1. Requirements Engineering

*In this section, it is suggested to capture the requirement description and specifications as provided by the client as well as any further clarification on it. It is also suggested to capture the requirements acceptance criteria and existing dependencies to other requirements. At last, identfy the involved input and output data and depicted an Actor-System interaction in order to fulfill the requirement.*

### 1.1. User Story Description

* As an administrator, I want to specify a new type of test and its collecting methods.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 
*From the Specification Document:*

-"Each test is characterized by an internal code, an NHS
code, a description that identifies the sample collection method, the date and time when the samples
were collected, the date and time of the chemical analysis, the date and time of the diagnosis made
by the specialist doctor, the date and time when the laboratory coordinator validated the test, and the
test type (whether it is blood test or Covid test)."

-"Despite being out of scope, the system should be developed having in mind the need to
easily support other kinds of tests (e.g., urine). Regardless, such tests rely on measuring one
or more parameters that can be grouped/organized by categories."

*From the client clarifications:*

> **Question:** In the US9 what do you mean by the collecting methods and  what collecting methods  are available?
>
> **Answer:** To make a Covid test you need a swab to collect a sample. To make a blood test you need sample tubes and a syringe.
>When the administrator (US9) specifies a new type of test, the administrator also specifies the method to collect a sample.
> The administrator introduces a brief description for each collecting method.
