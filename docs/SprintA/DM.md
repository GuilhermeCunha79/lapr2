# OO Analysis #

The construction process of the domain model is based on the client specifications, especially the nouns (for _
concepts_) and verbs (for _relations_) used.

## Rationale to identify domain conceptual classes ##

To identify domain conceptual classes, start by making a list of candidate conceptual classes inspired by the list of
categories suggested in the book "Applying UML and Patterns: An Introduction to Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and
Iterative Development".

### _Conceptual Class Category List_ ###

**Business Transactions**

* Test

---

**Transaction Line Items**

* Blood Sample
* Covid Sample
* Other Sample

---

**Product/Service related to a Transaction or Transaction Line Item**

* Parameter

**Roles of People or Organizations**

* ManyLabs
* NHS
* Client
* Receptionist

### **Rationale to identify associations between conceptual classes**
