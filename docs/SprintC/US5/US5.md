# US 005 - Register a sample of a given test

## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description

As a medical lab technician, I want to record the samples collected in the scope of a
given test.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications


**From the specifications document:**

>	



**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** "What kind of attributes should a sample have?"
> 
> **Answer:** "Each sample is associated with a test. A sample has only one attribute, a barcode number (UPC) that is a 
> sequential number and is automatically generated by the system. Each sample has a unique barcode number.
> 
> In US5, the medical lab technician checks the system and see all tests for which there are no samples collected. 
> The medical lab technician selects a test and the system asks for the number of samples to collect."

> **Question:** "Can a test have more than one sample?"
> 
> **Answer:** "Yes."

> **Question:** "What information does the medical lab technician needs to input to record a new sample?"
> 
> **Answer:** " The medical lab technician checks a list of tests and selects one. 
> Then, the application generates barcodes (one or more). 
> After printing the barcodes (one or more) the use case ends."

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria


* **AC1:** The system should support several barcode APIs
* **AC2:** The API to use is defined by configuration.
* **AC3:** A sample has only one attribute, a barcode number (UPC)
* **AC4:** Each sample has a unique barcode number
* **AC5:** The medical lab technician selects a test whit no samples
* **AC6:** The system asks for the number of samples to be registerd
* **AC7:** A test can have multiple samples
* **AC8:** After printing the barcodes (one or more) the use case ends


### 1.4. Found out Dependencies


* There is a dependency to "US 04 - Register a test to be performed" since at least a test must exist register a sample to it.


### 1.5 Input and Output Data


**Input Data:**

* Typed data:
  * Number of samples in the test
  * Sample barcode(UPC) 

* Selected data:
  * Test which the sample(s) shall be register in

**Output Data:**

* List of existing test without registered samples
* Test selected and question of the number of samples
* Sample/s barcode/s generated
* (In)Success of the operation

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks


* The created task stays in a "not published" state in order to distinguish from "published" tasks.

### 3.1. Rationale


| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1  		 |	... interacting with the actor? | RegisterSampleUI   |  **Pure Fabrication:** there is no reason to assign this responsibility to any other of the existing class in the Domain Model.           |
| 		 |	... coordinating the US? |  RegisterSampleController   |  **Controller**         |
|       | ... knows TestStore?	| Company  |  **IE** Company knows the TestStore to which is delegation some tasks        |
| Step 2		 |	|   |          |
| Step 3		 | 	|  |         |
| Step 4		 | |   |         |
| Step 5		 | 	|   |  TODO check this information        |
| Step 6		 | 	|   |  TODO check this information        |
| Step 7		 | 	|   |  TODO check this information        |
| Step 8		 | 	|   |  TODO check this information        |
| Step 9		 | ...savind the typed/selected data? 	| Test  |  **IE:** a Test knows its own data      |
| 		                 |	... instantiating a new Test? | TestStore   | **Creator (R1)** and **HC+LC**: By the application of the Creator (R1) it would be the "Company". But, by applying HC + LC to the "Company", this delegates that responsibility to the "TestStore"   |
|  		 			     |  ... knows TestStore?	 |  Company   |  **IE:** Company knows the TestStore to which it is delegating some tasks |
|  		             |	... validating all data (local validation)? | Test | **IE:** an object knows its data|
| 			  		 |	... validating all data (global validation)? | TestStore | **IE:** knows all the clients| 
| 			  		 |	... saving the test? | TestStore | **IE:** Knows all tests | 
| Step 10  |	... informing operation success?| CreateTestUI  | **IE:** is responsible for user interactions  |

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:


Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:
