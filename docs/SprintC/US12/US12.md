# US 012 - To record the results of a given test

## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description


As a clinical chemistry technologist, I intend to record the results of a given test



### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications


**From the specifications document:**

>   "At the company's headquarters, the clinical chemistry technologist receives the samples (delivered
by a courier) and performs the chemical analysis, recording the results in the software application."

>   "Blood tests are frequently characterized by measuring several parameters which for
presentation/reporting purposes are organized by categories. For example, parameters such
as the number of Red Blood Cells (RBC), White Blood Cells (WBC) and Platelets (PLT) are
usually presented under the blood count (Hemogram) category."

>   "Covid tests are characterized by measuring a single parameter stating whether it is a positive
or a negative result."

>   "The application should use an external module that is responsible for providing the test reference values.
The application can use an external module for each type of test.
For instance, when the results are for blood tests parameters, the
external module BloodReferenceValues1API can be used. When the results are for
Covid-19 tests parameters, the external module CovidReferenceValues1API can be used.
In any case, the API request should include, at most: (i) a key to access the module
(e.g.: “KEY1234”); (ii) a parameter identifier; (iii) the reference date; and (iv) reference
measurement unit (e.g. "mg")."


**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** Are the reference values, for each parameter, going to be delivered to the groups? If so, when and how?
>
> **Answer:** You should use the APIs available in moodle to obtain the reference values.

> **Question:** Does this "at most" express that there are some parameters of the API request that are optional? If so, could you clarify the parameters that are optional?
>
> **Answer:** "At most" means the maximum number of parameters that will be used. Depending on the API being used, all parameters above may be required or some may be optional.
>
> **Important: The number of parameters depends on the API that is being used.**

> **Question:** When you intend to record the results of the Blood Test, do you want to introduce all results for all parameters or just only one?
>
> **Answer:** The clinical chemistry technologist should record all results related to a test at a given time/moment.

> **Question:** When the Clinical Chemistry Technologist wants to record the results of a test, how does he have access to that test? By internal code, NHS code?
>
> **Answer:** Each sample has a unique barcode. The clinical chemistry technologist should use the sample barcode number to find the test for which the sample was collected.

> **Question:** Should the system present a result for each test parameter, or a single result for the test to be recorded?
>
> **Answer:** The Clinical Chemistry Technologist should register a value/result for each parameter of the test.

> **Question**: What information is the system going to have to ask the clinical chemistry technologist to be able to create the test results?
>
>**Answer1:**: The clinical Chemistry Technologist should use the sample barcode number to find (in the system) the test for which the sample was collected.
>**Answer2:**: The Clinical Chemistry Technologist should register a value/result for each parameter of the (selected) test.
>All parameter values of the test should be filled/defined (by the Clinical Chemistry Technologist) when the use case finishes.


### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria


* **AC1:** The application should use an external module that is responsible
  for providing the test reference values. The application can use an external module for
  each type of test. For instance, when the results are for blood tests parameters, the
  externalmodule BloodReferenceValues1API can be used. When the results are for
  Covid-19 tests parameters, the external module CovidReferenceValues1API can be used.
  In any case, the API request should include, at most:
  >(i) a key to access the module (e.g.:  “KEY1234”);
  >
  >(ii) a parameter identifier;
  >
  >(iii) the reference date; and (iv) reference
  measurement unit (e.g. "mg").



### 1.4. Found out Dependencies


* There is a dependency to "US5: As a medical lab technician, I want to record the samples collected in the scope of a
  given test." since at least a test must exist for a record to be created.


### 1.5 Input and Output Data


**Input Data:**

* Typed data:
    - Result

* Selected data:
    - Test



**Output Data:**
- Result's preview of the test

### 3.1. Rationale

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1  		 |	... interacting with the actor? | RecordResultUI   |  Pure Fabrication: there is no reason to assign this responsibility to any existing class in the Domain Model.           |
| 			  		 |	... coordinating the US? | RecordResultController | Controller                             |
| 			  		 |	... instantiating a new Result? | Employee (Clinical Chemistry Technologist)   |  in the DM Employee with Clinical Chemistry Technologist role records the result.   |
| 			  		 |	... knowing to which test the result belongs to? | Test  | IE: knows its own data (qrcode, result) |
| Step 2  		 |	...saving the inputted data? | Result  | IE: object created in step 1 has its own data.  |
| Step 3  		 |	...knowing the Result categories to show? | Test  | IE: Result Categories are defined by the test specifications. |
| Step 4  		 |	... saving the selected category? | ParameterTestResult  | IE: object created in step 1 is classified in one Category.  |
| Step 5  		 |							 |             |                              |              
| Step 6  		 |	... validating all data (local validation)? | ParameterTestResult | IE: owns its data.| 
| 			  		 |	... validating all data (global validation)? | Test | IE: knows all its results.| 
| 			  		 |	... saving the created Result? | Test | IE: owns the respective result.| 
| Step 7  		 |	... informing operation success?| RecordResultUI  | IE: is responsible for user interactions.  | 
### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

* Employee
* Test
* ParameterTestResult

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:

* RecordResultUI
* RecordResultController

# 4. Tests

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Result class with null values.

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
		Result instance = new Result(null, null, null, null, null, null, null);
	}


**Test 2:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Result class with a reference containing less than five chars - AC2.

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureReferenceMeetsAC2() {
		Category cat = new Category(10, "Category 10");
		
		Result instance = new Result("Ab1", "Result Description", "Informal Data", "Technical Data", 3, 3780, cat);
	}


*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.*

# 5. Construction (Implementation)


## Class RecordResultController

		public boolean createResult(String ref, String designation, String informalDesc, 
			String technicalDesc, Integer duration, Double cost, Integer catId)() {
		
			Category cat = this.platform.getCategoryById(catId);
			
			Organization org;
			// ... (omitted)
			
			this.result = org.createResult(ref, designation, informalDesc, technicalDesc, duration, cost, cat);
			
			return (this.result != null);
		}


## Class Organization


		public Result createResult(String ref, String designation, String informalDesc, 
			String technicalDesc, Integer duration, Double cost, Category cat)() {
		
	
			Result result = new Result(ref, designation, informalDesc, technicalDesc, duration, cost, cat);
			if (this.validateResult(Result))
				return result;
			return null;
		}



# 6. Integration and Demo

* A new option on the Employee menu options was added.

* Some demo purposes some Results are bootstrapped while system starts.


# 7. Observations

Platform and Organization classes are getting too many responsibilities due to IE pattern and, therefore, they are becoming huge and harder to maintain.

Is there any way to avoid this to happen?
