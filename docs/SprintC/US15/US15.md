# US15 - To validate the work done by the clinical chemistry technologist and specialist doctor

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

*As a laboratory coordinator, I want to validate the work done by the clinical chemistry technologist and specialist doctor.*

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications
*From the Specification Document:*



> "After the specialist doctor has completed the diagnosis, the results of the clinical analyses and the report become available in the system and must be validated by the laboratory coordinator."
> 
>"To validate the work done, the laboratory coordinator checks the chemical test/result and associated diagnosis made and confirms 
that everything was done correctly."
> 
> "Once the laboratory coordinator confirms that everything was done correctly, 
the client receives a notification alerting that the results are already available in the central application and 
informing that he/she must access the application to view those results. The client receives the notification by SMS and e-mail. 
At the same time, the results are also available in the central application where the medical lab technicians who collect the samples, the clinical chemistry technologist, the specialist doctor, and the laboratory coordinator can check them."


*From the Client Specifications:*

> **Question:** Regarding the process of validating a certain test/result, what validation states should be considered by the laboratory coordinator?
For example, can "Valid" or "Invalid" be accepted as a confirmation for the chemical test/result and its diagnosis?
>
>**Answer:**
Only Valid state. The system shows all tests ready to validate (tests that already have the test registration date, the chemical analysys date and the diagnosis date registered in the system) and the laboratory coordinator selects one or more tests to mark as validated.
>
> **Question:** Does the laboratory coordinator choose which client's results to validate??
>
>**Answer:**
The laboratory coordinator chooses a set of tests he wants to validate.
> 
> **Question:** How should the laboratory coordinator choose the test to operate on, from a list of all the tests with a result and report or by inputting the code unique to a specific test?
>
> **Answer:**
From a list of all tests that have a test registration date, a chemical analysis date and a diagnosis date.
>
> **Question:** : What information does the laboratory coordinator needs to be able to do validate a test? We got from the description that it's supposed to show all dates. Should the system provide any more information?
>
> **Answer:**
> Only the dates.
> 
> **Question** After validation do we need to have the time and date of the validation?
> 
> **Answer** Yes, the system should record the date (DD/MM/YYYY) and time (HH:MM) when the validation was made.
Moreover, in this US, when the system shows to the laboratory coordinator all the dates (test registration date, chemical analysis date and diagnosis date), the system should show the date (DD/MM/YYYY) and the time (HH:MM).


### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

* **AC1:** The system does not show client personal information but shows all dates(test registration code, chemical analysis date and diagnosis date);
* **AC2:** The system should record the validation date.
* **AC3:** The system should present one list with tests ready to validate.
* **AC4:** The lab coordinator can validate all tests or just a selection of tests.


### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

There is dependency with the "US04 - Register a test to be performed", "US12 - To record the results of a given test" and "US14 - to make the diagnosis and write a report for a given test", because in order to validate the work done by the clinical chemistry technologist and specialist doctor, is need the work done by them, such as the dates.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

*Input Data*

-Typed Data: n/a

-Output Data: Notification to the client by email and SMS informing that the results are available on the central application.
(In)Success of the operation.

## 3. Design - User Story Realization

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1                 |	... interacting with the actor? | ValidationUI   |  **Pure Fabrication:** there is no reason to assign this responsibility to any existing class in the Domain Model           |
| 			  		     |	... coordinating the US? | ValidationController | **Controller**                             |
|  |... knows TestStore ?    | Company                  | **IE** Company knows the TestStore to which is delegation some tasks
|                    |  ... knows tests ready to validate ? | TestStore     | **IE** Knows the tests that are ready to validate
|                    |  ... knows the test diagnosis date ?| Test | **IE** Test knows the DiagnosisReport object|
|                    |  ... knows the chemical analysis date ?  | Test | **IE** Test knows a list of test results |
|                    |  ... knows test creation date ?  | Test | **IE** Knows it's own data|
| Step 2                 |							 |             |                              |
| 	Step 3  	                 |	... instantiating a new validation? | TestStore   | **Creator (R1)** and **HC+LC**: By the application of the Creator (R1) it would be the "Company". But, by applying HC + LC to the "Company", this delegates that responsibility to the "ClientStore"   |
|  		 			     |  ... knows ValidationStore?	 |  Company   |  **IE:** Company knows the ValidationStore to which it is delegating some tasks |
| Step 4                 |	                |                   |                   |	
| Step 5	     	     |	... saving the validation? | TestStore | **IE:** Knows all validations| 
| 			  		     |	... sending email and SMS? | SendingEmailSMS | **IE** and **Pure Fabrication:** has all the required information and means to send the email (IE). However, to avoid code duplication (cf. US7) this responsibility might be assign to a common and shared artificial class, specialized in this task.| 
| | ... knows all the tests validations ?                     | TestStore | **IE** TestStore knows all the tests that have been validated                    |
| 			  		     |	... validating all data ? | TestStore | **IE:** knows all the validations|
| Step 6                 |	... informing operation success?| ValidationUI  | **IE:** is responsible for user interactions  | 


### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:
* Company
* TestValidation
* Report
* Results

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:
* ValidationUI
* TestStore
* ValidationController
* SendingEmailSMS

# 4. Tests
*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling.*


**Test 1:** 

	@Test
    public void testTestWithoutValidation() {
        List<Parameter> lp = new ArrayList<>();
        lp.add(p1);
        Assert.assertNotNull(ctrl.getTestWithoutValidation());
    }

**Test 2:** 

	 @Test
    public void testReadyToValidateMapper() {
        ParameterCategory pc1 = new ParameterCategory("54321", "adaca");
        TypeOfTest tpt = new TypeOfTest("12345", "noth", "mao", pc1);

        lp.add(p2);
        List<CATest> cat = new ArrayList<>();
        Client client = new Client(clDto);
        CATest ct1 = new CATest("123456789111", client, tpt, lp, "lol");
        CATest ct2 = new CATest("123456783233", client, tpt1, lp, "ll");
        ct1.addReport(new Report("adknfajnf"));
        ct2.addReport(new Report("adknfajnf"));
        cat.add(ct1);
        cat.add(ct2);
        List<String> expected = new ArrayList<>();
        expected.add(String.format("Internal Code: 000000000001 | NHS Code: 123456789111 | Created on: %s | Collected at: null | Reported at: %s |", new DateTime(), new DateTime()));
        expected.add(String.format("Internal Code: 000000000002 | NHS Code: 123456783233 | Created on: %s | Collected at: null | Reported at: %s |", new DateTime(), new DateTime()));
        assertEquals(expected, TestReadyToValidateMapper.toDtoVal(cat));
    }


# 5. Construction (Implementation)

#Class ValidationController


    public ValidationController() {
        this(App.getInstance().getCompany());
    }

    public ValidationController(Company company) {
        testStore = company.getTestStore();
    }


    public List<String> getTestWithoutValidation() {
        List<CATest> readyToValidate = testStore.getTestWithoutValidation();
        if (readyToValidate != null) {
            TestReadyToValidateMapper trv = new TestReadyToValidateMapper();
            return trv.toDtoVal(readyToValidate);
        }
        return null;
    }


    public String getTestResults(String testCode) {
        this.test = testStore.getTestByCode(testCode);
        return test.getTestValidation();
    }

    public boolean saveValidation() {
        return this.test.addValidation();
    }

    public String getTestByCode(String testCode) {
        this.test = testStore.getTestByCode(testCode);
        return test.getTestResults();
    }
    
    public boolean doValidation(List<String> testValidationList) {
        return testStore.doValidation(testValidationList);
    }
