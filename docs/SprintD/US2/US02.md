## 3. Design - User Story Realization 

### 3.1. Rationale


| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1 | ...interacting with the user? | ClientUI | Pure Fabrication: There are no reasons to assign this task to any class of the domain |
| 		 | ...managing the US? | ChangeClientDataController | Controller: The controller is responsible to make the bridge between UI layer and Domain Layer |
| Step 2 | 									| 														| 												|
| Step 3 | ...send data from UI to Domain? | ChangeClientDataController | Controller |
| 		 | ...knows the ClientStore? | Company | IE: Company knows all its stores |
| 		 | ...knowing client data? | Client | IE: Each client knows its own data |
| Step 4 | 					| 				|						 |
| Step 5 | ...storing the changes provided? | ClientDTO | Creator: Client will store its own clients |
|			    |	... saving the client? | ClientStore | **IE:** Knows all clients|
| Step 6 | 									| 								| 														|
| Step 7 | ...validating the changes made? | Client | IE: knows its own data and also knows each acceptance criteria |
| Step 8 | ...informing success of the operation? | ClientUI | It's always responsible for user interaction |


### Systematization ##

 - Company

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 

 - ClientUI
 - ChangeClientDataController
