# US 02 - To update client's personal data.

## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description


As a client, I want to update my personal data.



### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 


**From the specifications document:**

n/a

**From the client clarifications:**
> **Question:** When we update the client's information, should we send an email informing that the client's data has been changed? If so, what should this email contain?
> 
> **Answer:** Yes. The e-mail message should only inform the client that his personal data has been updated.
> 

> **Question** Should/Can we show the current data held in the client's account? If so, we think that showing certain information(Password, for example) could violate some security purposes. How should we approach that situation?
> 
> **Answer** The client can only update his: name, address, phone number and sex attributes. The other attributes can not be updated. There are some restrictions that forced me to make this decision.


### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

* **AC1:** The client can only update his: name, address, phone number and sex attributes.
* **AC2:** A email should be sent to the client when we make the wished changes.


### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

* There is a dependency to "US03 - Register a new Client", because in order to modify the Client data that Client must be registered in the system.
* There is a dependency to "US07 - Register a new Employee", because in order to modify the Client data that Client must be registered in the system by a receptionist.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data


**Input Data:**

* Typed data:
	* personal changes


* Selected data:
	*

**Output Data:**

* Modification of a Client Data
* (In)Success of the operation

### 3.1. Rationale


| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1 | ...interacting with the user? | ClientChangesUI | Pure Fabrication: There are no reasons to assign this task to any class of the domain |
| 		 | ...managing the US? | ChangeClientDataController | Controller: The controller is responsible to make the bridge between UI layer and Domain Layer |
| Step 2 | 									| 														| 												|
| Step 3 | ...send data from UI to Domain? | ChangeClientDataController | Controller |
| 		 | ...knows the ClientStore? | Company | IE: Company knows all its stores |
| 		 | ...knowing client data? | Client | IE: Each client knows its own data |
| Step 4 | 					| 				|						 |
| Step 5 | ...storing the changes provided? | Client | Creator: Client will store its own clients |
|			    |	... saving the client? | ClientStore | IE: Knows all clients|
| Step 6 | 									| 								| 														|
| Step 7 | ...validating the changes made? | Client | IE: knows its own data and also knows each acceptance criteria |
| Step 8 | ...informing success of the operation? | ClientChangesUI | It's always responsible for user interaction |


### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

 - Company
 - Client

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 

 - ClientChangesUI
 - ChangeClientDataController
 - ClientStore
