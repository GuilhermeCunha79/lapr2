# US 018 - Send Covid19 reports to the NHS

## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description

As an Administrator I want to send the Covid-19 report to the NHS at any time. I
want to define the interval of dates to fit the regression model, the number of historical
points (number of days or number of weeks) that must be sent to the NHS, the regression
model to use and select the independent variables to use.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications


**From the specifications document:**
* Considering that Many Labs has the exclusivity to perform Covid-19 tests, and that the contract
  with the NHS in England requires Many Labs to summarize and report Covid-19 data, the company
  needs to: identify the number of Covid-19 tests performed, identify all positive results to Covid-19
  tests, report the total number of Covid-19 cases per day, per week and per month of the year, and
  send the forecasts for these same time horizons (the number of Covid-19 cases for the following
  day, next week and next month). The company is also required to generate daily (automatic) reports
  with all the information demanded by the NHS and should send them to the NHS using their API.
  To make the predictions, the NHS contract defines that a linear regression algorithm should be used.
  The NHS required that both simple linear and multiple linear regression algorithms should be
  evaluated to select the best model. The accuracy of the prediction models should be analysed and
  documented in the application user manual (in the annexes) that must be delivered with the
  application. The algorithm to be used by the application must be defined through a configuration
  file.

* **US18:** As an Administrator I want to send the Covid-19 report to the NHS at any time. I
want to define the interval of dates to fit the regression model, the number of historical
points (number of days or number of weeks) that must be sent to the NHS, the regression
model to use and select the independent variables to use.
  
 * **Acceptance Criteria:**  The system should allow the Administrator to select
   between a simple linear and multilinear regression model to fit the data.
   Moreover, the Administrator should be able to choose the independent variable to
   use with the simple linear regression model (either the number of tests realized or
   the mean age). The system should send the report using the NHS API (available
   in moodle).



**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** "From Sprint D requirements we get "I want to define... the number of historical points (number of days or number of weeks) that must be sent to the NHS".
Is the Administrator who must choose between days or weeks? If so, how should he make this choice?"
> 
> **Answer:** "Yes. The Administrator should select between days and weeks using the user interface."

> **Question:** "From the project description it is known "send the forecasts for these same time horizons (the number of Covid-19 cases for the following day, next week and next month)." In the example report we have in moodle, there is a line that says "// Prediction values". Does this mean that after this line we should put our predictions or it refers to the following table?"
> 
> **Answer:** "Yes, the prediction values are the ones available in the table that we include in the example."

> **Question:** " Regarding US18 and US19, it is only one report containing all the tests performed by Many Labs to be sent each time, correct? Or is it one report per laboratory, for example? Or other option?"
> 
> **Answer:** "The report should contain all the tests made by Many Labs."


> **Question:** "Should the report contain the data of all the tests with results (with or without report, with or without validation) or contain only the validated tests? (Or other option?)"
> 
> **Answer:** "The NHS Covid report should include statistics computed only from validated tests."

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria


* **AC1:** The system should allow the Administrator to select between a simple linear and multilinear regression model to fit the data.
* **AC2:** The Administrator should be able to choose the independent variable to use with the simple linear regression model (either the number of tests realized or the mean age)
* **AC3:** The system should send the report using the NHS API (available in moodle).
* **AC4:** The NHS Covid report should include statistics computed only from validated tests.

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1  		 |	                     |             |                              |
| Step 2  |		... interacting with the actor? | SendReportUI   |  **Pure Fabrication:** there is no reason to assign this responsibility to any other of the existing class in the Domain Model.           |
| 		 |	... coordinating the US? |  SendReportController   |  **Controller**         |
|       | ... knows TestStore?	| Company  |  **IE** Company knows the TestStore to which is delegation some tasks
| Step 3		|... gets the selected measure? 	|  SendReportController |      **Controller**     |
| Step 4		|                        |             |                              |
| Step 5		 | ... receives the interval of time ?	| RegressionModel  |   **IE**  object created in step 1 has its own data.   |
| Step 6		 |	                     |             |                              |
| Step 7		 |...receives the complexity selected and the independent variable?   |   RegressionModel        |       **IE**  object created in step 1 has its own data.                       |
| Step 8		 |	                     |             |                              |
| Step 9		 |	 ...receives the values of the independent variable?              |   RegressionModel            |                              |
| Step 10		 |	                     |             |                              |
| Step 11		 |	 ...receives the report?                  |    NHS         |                              |
|Step 12		 | ... informing operation success?| SendReportUI  | **IE** is responsible for user interactions.  |
